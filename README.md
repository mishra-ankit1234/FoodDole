DESCRIPTION-
The focus of this project is to reduce the amount of food wasted and being used to the needy people.
We have developed a food donation platform wherein a person as a donar can donate her/his leftover food to poors and fill their stomach. The platform for food donation acts as an interface between the users who are looking for a channel to give the excess food without wasting it. It enables us to donate the excess food by notifying nearby users with the details of the food that is available. The Food Donation Project System is designed in such a way that the users have two options to select.
1. Donor:looking to donate food, login using username and password then fill the food details such as name of the food, type of the food and the excess quantity.
2. Volunteer:claiming for the food, then she/he needs to enter the contact details of the organization that he belongs to with the address and unique id.

The system is designed in the way that one or more users can donate the food. If there is more than one user to claim the food, the volunteers filter out the claimed food by using filters like date, time and location.
